To find out which Azure Logic Apps are connected to a specific Azure Storage account, you can follow these steps:Azure Portal: Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your credentials.Navigate to Storage Accounts: In the Azure portal, search for "Storage accounts" in the search bar at the top and select it from the search results. This will display a list of all your Azure Storage accounts.Select the Storage Account: Click on the specific Azure Storage account that you want to inspect. This will open the overview page for that storage account.Access Metrics and Activity: In the left-hand menu of the storage account overview page, click on "Metrics" or "Activity log" under the Monitoring section. This will give you insights into recent activities and metrics related to the storage account, but it won't directly show Logic App connections.Review Storage Account Settings: Look for any settings related to access controls or logging that might give you clues about integrations with other Azure services, but again, this won't directly show Logic App connections.Using Azure Monitor (Advanced): For more detailed analysis, you can use Azure Monitor. Navigate to the Azure Monitor service from the Azure portal. From there, you can create custom queries or views to analyze activities related to the Storage Account. This may require familiarity with Azure Monitor queries and logs.Check Logic App Connections (Recommended): The most direct method to find which Logic Apps are connected to a Storage Account is to review each Logic App individually, as described in the previous response:Navigate to each Logic App in the Azure portal.In the Logic App designer, inspect the triggers and actions configured for the Logic App.Look for triggers related to Azure Storage (e.g., "When a blob is added or modified (properties only)").Review the connections used in these triggers to see if they are linked to the specific Storage Account you are interested in.By following these steps, you can effectively determine which Azure Logic Apps are connected to a particular Azure Storage Account and inspect their configurations as needed. This approach allows you to verify integration details and manage connections efficiently within your Azure environment.

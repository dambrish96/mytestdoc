To send Logic App failure notifications based on log data over Microsoft Teams, you can follow a slightly different approach compared to triggering directly from the Logic App. Hereâ€™s a general outline of how you can achieve this:Set up Log Analytics (Azure Monitor):Ensure your Logic App is configured to send diagnostic logs to Azure Monitor. This involves enabling diagnostics settings for your Logic App to send logs to a Log Analytics workspace.Create a Log Analytics Alert:In the Azure portal, navigate to your Log Analytics workspace.Go to Alerts (under Monitoring) and click on "+ New alert rule".Configure the condition for your alert rule based on the log data. For example, set the condition to trigger when a Logic App run fails (you can use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to define this condition).Define Action Group for Notification:When configuring the alert rule, define an Action Group that specifies how you want to be notified.Click on "+ Add action group" and select "Teams - Send actionable message (Office 365 Connector)".Configure Teams Actionable Message:In the Action Group configuration:Select the Teams actionable message connector.Configure the message details such as title, summary, and details using dynamic content from the alert payload (which includes information about the failure).Select the Teams channel or user(s) who should receive the notification.Test and Save the Alert Rule:Test the alert rule to ensure that when a failure condition is met (e.g., Logic App failure), the alert triggers and sends a notification to Microsoft Teams.Adjust Alerts and Notifications as Needed:Fine-tune the alert rule and notification settings based on your team's requirements.Monitor the alerts in Azure Monitor to ensure they trigger correctly for Logic App failures.By setting up alerts based on log data in Azure Monitor and configuring notifications through Microsoft Teams, you can ensure that your team receives timely notifications whenever a Logic App failure occurs, helping to streamline troubleshooting and response efforts.

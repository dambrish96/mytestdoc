To create a Logic App that sends a binary file using a PFX certificate to a specified host, you'll typically need to use Azure Logic Apps along with Azure Key Vault for securely storing the certificate. Hereâ€™s a high-level outline of how you can achieve this:Prerequisites:Azure Subscription: You need an Azure subscription to create Azure Logic Apps and Azure Key Vault.PFX Certificate: Ensure you have the PFX certificate (.pfx file) and its password ready.Azure Key Vault: You'll use Key Vault to store and retrieve the PFX certificate securely.Destination Host: Know the host to which you want to send the binary file.Steps to Create the Logic App:1. Store the PFX Certificate in Azure Key VaultUpload your PFX certificate to Azure Key Vault. You can do this via the Azure portal or programmatically using Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.Make sure to note down the Key Vault URL and the certificate's secret name (which will be used in the Logic App).2. Create the Logic AppGo to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) and create a new Logic App:Search for "Logic App" in the Azure Marketplace and create a blank Logic App.Give it a name, select the subscription, resource group, and region.3. Add a TriggerAdd a trigger that initiates the Logic App workflow. For example, you can use an HTTP trigger to start the Logic App manually or based on a schedule.4. Add ActionsRetrieve PFX Certificate from Key Vault:Add an action to retrieve the PFX certificate from Azure Key Vault. Use the "Azure Key Vault - Get secret" action. Provide the Key Vault URL and the secret name (where the PFX certificate is stored).This action will retrieve the PFX certificate along with its password.Send Binary File:Use an HTTP action (or an appropriate connector based on your destination host's API) to send the binary file.Configure the action with the appropriate HTTP method (POST, PUT, etc.), URL of the destination host, headers, and the binary file content.Ensure to set the headers as required by the destination host (e.g., content-type, authentication if needed).5. Configure Certificate for HTTPS Connection (if needed)If the destination host requires client certificate authentication (using the PFX certificate):Ensure the HTTP action or connector supports configuring client certificates.Use the certificate retrieved from Key Vault as the client certificate in your HTTP request.6. Save and Test the Logic AppSave your Logic App and test it thoroughly to ensure it retrieves the certificate from Key Vault correctly and sends the binary file to the specified host.Additional Considerations:Security: Ensure that all sensitive information, such as the Key Vault URL, secret names, and the PFX password, are securely managed.Error Handling: Implement error handling and retries in your Logic App to handle failures gracefully.Logging: Enable logging and monitoring for your Logic App to track its execution and performance.By following these steps, you can create a Logic App that securely sends a binary file using a PFX certificate to a specified host. Adjust the steps and actions based on specific requirements and the capabilities of the destination host's API or service.
